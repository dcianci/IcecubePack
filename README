Hey there friends!

This is a bit annoying to do locally and I haven't come up with a good way to automate it, but if you follow these steps, it should build!

1) Clone in SQuIDS
git clone https://github.com/jsalvado/SQuIDS.git

2) Follow instructions to build it! It should be pretty clean and easy.

3) Clone in nuSQuIDS
git clone https://github.com/arguelles/nuSQuIDS.git

4) Follow instructions to build it! This one is a bit trickier! It has some dependencies. 
You need to make sure you have hdf5 installed (find it here https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/)
And you need to make sure nuSQuIDS knows where hdf5 and SQuIDS live, which you can do as a configure option.

5) Fix up the makefile in this directory with the SQuIDS and nuSQuIDS locations. Hopefully the hdf5 stuff is alright,  but if something goes wrong, that's the first place to look.

6) Build it all!
make -f makefile
