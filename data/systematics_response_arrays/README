/systematics_response_arrays:
==============================

In order to assess systematic uncertainties due to detector effects we also
provide the response arrays for different non-nominal detector configurations.

The following list of systematic sets are provided:

- DOM efficiency variants: 0.9, 0.95, 1.089, and 1.1979.
- SPICELEA ice model.
- SPICEMIE icevariant1 (+10% scattering) and icevariant2 (+10% absorption).
- SPICEMIE ice model with no hole ice.

For reference, we also provide the nominal response array:

- SPICEMIE ice model with 0.99 DOM efficiency.

These arrays, which have units of GeV cm^2 s sr, have the following indexes:

T_{mu_e,cth,nu_e}

where mu_e is the index that represent the reconstructed muon energy bin, 
cth to the cos(th) bin, and nu_e corresponds to the true neutrino energy bin.

In order to estimate the total number of events in a given reconstructed
quantities bin one has to perform the following convolution:

N_{mu_e,cth} = T_{mu_e,cth,nu_e} * Phi{cth,nu_e}	...(1)

where in the right hand side summation over the repeated nu_e index is assumed
and Phi corresponds to the average neutrino flux in the bin with indices cth
and nu_e.

In order to facilitate the convolution given in equation (1) we also provide
the average per bin fluxes in the same binning in atmospheric_flux/averaged/
directory for the models used in the analysis.

The arrays are given in HDF5 format and have the following data sets:

antineutrino_response_array 	Dataset {10, 21, 200}
neutrino_response_array 	Dataset {10, 21, 200}
costh_bin_edges          	Dataset {22}
proxy_energy_bin_edges   	Dataset {11}
true_energy_bin_edges    	Dataset {201}

where the numbers in braces are the sizes along each dimension of the set.

Finally, it is important to note that neutrino_response_array must be
convolved with the corresponding average neutrino fluxes and the 
antineutrino_response_array with the corresponding average antineutrino fluxes.
Then to compare to the data, one must add the resulting products.
